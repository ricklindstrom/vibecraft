 - [X] POLISH: Make two types of water layers. Make water surface shiny. Properly aligm subsurface water layers.
 - [X] POLISH: Fix shadows
 - [X] LOD: Implement level of detail (LOD)
 - [X] STRUCTURES: Add generic structure support
 - [X] STRUCTURES: Add houses.
 - [X] DEBUG: Fix FPS display in debug panel.
 - [X] PERF: Optimize speed of minimap (It cuts FPS in half)
 - [X] CHUNKS: Create a minimap showing chunk debug info
 - [X] LOD: Use larger block sizes for distant chunks
 - [X] STRUCTURES: Relocate tree creation out of world class
 - [X] TERRAIN + PERF: Only create subsurface blocks if the terrain is sufficently sloped
 - [X] TERRAIN CALC + STRUCTURES: Add support for terrain overrides to support player collision for strutures.
 - [X] STRUCTURES: Make houses with different styles
 - [X] STRUCTURES + TERRAIN: Support multple levels of terrain overrides to support multi-story buildings
 - [X] STRUCTURES: Don't add trees where structures are located.
 - [X] STRUCTURES: Add an AIR block type that can be used in structures but is ignored during render. Add sample 'gazebo' with air walls.
 - [X] TERRAIN DISP: Allow swiching between displaying surfaces and blocks
 - [ ] CHUNKS: Use frustum to determine which chunks to load
 - [.] STRUCTURES: Add new roof types

 - [ ] POLISH: Add detail to blocks.
 - [ ] TERRAIN CALC: Add proper smoothing to spline function.
 - [ ] STRUCTURES: Add castles.
 - [ ] STRUCTURES: Add roads.
 - [ ] STRUCTURES: Create advanced house building system (L-System)?
 - [ ] TERRAIN CALC + STRUCTURES: Add terrain rating score for home building to identify good locations for building houses/castles. (Flat near water? Tops of hills?)
 - [ ] POLISH: Add cloud layer
 - [ ] POLISH: Rotate minimap to align with direction of player.
 - [ ] TERRAIN CALC: Improve perlin noise function to make more natural terrain.
