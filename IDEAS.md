What if we encode a cell/room/house based on its four walls.

w = wall with window
W = 3 = wall
d = wall with door
a = arch
0 = ' ' = empty
b = battlement = [-_-_-] = 21212 maybe
1 = '_' = f = fence = [_____] = 11111 maybe
2 = '-' = F = fence = [-----] = 22222 maybe
. = assert that the segment has been previously defined



'SWNE'

['dwww'] = tiny house


['dww ','w.ww'] = 2 house horizontal
[['dw w'],['.www']] = 2 house vertical
[[['dwww']],[['wwww']]] = 2 story tiny house

[['dw  ','w  w'],[' ww ','  ww']] = 4 house

[[['dw  ','w  w'],[' ww ','  ww']],
 [['ww  ','w  w'],[' ww ','  ww']] = 2 story 4 house

[[['dw  ','F'],['T','J']],
 [['L','F'],['T','J']] = 2 story 4 house


alternate naming scheme?
O
F-T
[ ]
L_J
