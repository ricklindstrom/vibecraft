What if we encode a room based on its four walls.

w = wall with window
W = wall
d = wall with door
a = arch
0 or ' ' = empty
b = battlement = [-_-_-] = 21212 maybe
1 or '_' = fence = [_____] = 11111 maybe
2 or '-' = fence = [-----] = 22222 maybe
. = assert that the segment has been previously defined


'SWNE'

['dwww'] = tiny house


['dww ','w.ww'] = 2 house horizontal
[['dw w'],['.www']] = 2 house vertical

[['dw  ','w  w'],[' ww ','  ww']] = 4 house

alternate naming scheme?
